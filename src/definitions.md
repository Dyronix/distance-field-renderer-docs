|**mesh shader**          | A shader that combines vertex and primitive processing. |
|**compute-based**        | A method that prefers compute shaders over alternative approaches |
|**boilerplate**          | Sections of the code that are repeated in multiple places often with no variation |
|**implicit function**    | A relation of the form R(X_1,â€¦,X_n)=0, where R is a function of several variables |
|**oct-tree**             | A tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly eight children. Often used to partition a three-dimensional space. |
|**surface normal**       | A vector perpendicular to a given surface. |
|**instrumentation**      | Adding instructions to the target program to collect the required information |
|**ray tracing**          | A technique for modeling light transport for use in various rendering algorithms to produce digital images of a 3D world. |
|**g-buffer**             | The outcome of the first pass from a deferred rendering pipeline. Commonly consists of positions, normal, albedo, and specular color of each surface within a 3D world. |
|**back buffer**          | The buffer stored in VRAM, where all drawing operations store their results |
|**front buffer**         | The buffer that is copied into video RAM when all drawing operations are completed |
|**present**              | Swapping the back buffer and front buffer |
|**double buffering**     | A technique for drawing graphics that shows no (or less) stutter tearing, and other artifacts |
|**deferred rendering**   | A screen-space shading technique performed on a second rendering pass. Commonly used to speed up per pixel light computations. |
|**cache miss**           | A state where the requested data for processing a component or application is not found in the cache memory. |
|**color ramp**           | A specified range of position-dependent colors is usually used to fill a region. |
|**shadow mapping**       | A process by which shadows are added to 3D computer graphics. |
|**ambient occlusion**    | A shading technique used to calculate how exposed each point in a scene is to ambient lighting. |
|**blit**                 | Copies a source buffer into a destination buffer by using a shader. |
